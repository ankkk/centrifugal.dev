HTTP streaming connection endpoint in Centrifugo is:

```
/connection/http_stream
```

:::info

This transport is only implemented by our Javascript SDK at this point â€“ as it mostly makes sense as a fallback for WebSocket to have real-time connection in an environment where WebSocket is unavailable. These days those envs are mostly corporate networks which can block WebSocket traffic (even TLS-based).

:::

Here is an example how to use JavaScript SDK with WebSocket as the main transport and HTTP-streaming transport fallback:

```javascript title="Use HTTP-streaming with bidirectional emulation as a fallback for WebSocket in JS SDK"
const transports = [
    {
        transport: 'websocket',
        endpoint: 'ws://localhost:8000/connection/websocket'
    },
    {
        transport: 'http_stream',
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:8000/connection/http_stream'
    }
];
const centrifuge = new Centrifuge(transports);
centrifuge.connect()
```

Make sure [allowed_origins](../server/configuration.md#allowed_origins) are properly configured.
